## The whole list

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its XEP series. This page lists Stable and Final XEPs as well as experimental proposals that are currently under consideration.

XEP series data can be explored using [data.xmpp.net/explore](https://data.xmpp.net/explore/).

Good places for developers to start are the [compliance suites](https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites-current), as well as the [technology overview pages](https://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/). For further reading, we suggest the independent [Modern XMPP project](https://docs.modernxmpp.org/) which attempts to improve the quality of user-to-user messaging applications that use XMPP.
