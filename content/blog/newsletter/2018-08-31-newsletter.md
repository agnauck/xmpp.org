Welcome to the XMPP newsletter.

If you have an article, tutorial or blog post you'd like us to include in the
newsletter, please [submit it on the XMPP wiki](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).

This month's newsletter is a bit thinner than usual, no doubt due to the summer
holidays in the northern hemisphere.

## News

Maxime “pep.” Buquet has written a great report on the progress made at the recent
[XMPP sprint held at the Collabora offices in Cambridge](https://blog.bouah.net/2018/08/cambridge-xmpp-sprint/).

The XMPP server compliance tester, started by Daniel Gultsch from
Conversations.im, has been [improved by Rishi Raj](https://rishiraj.me/articles/2018-07/final-dash)
for Google Summer of Code and has a new website.

You can now test how compliant your server is at [compliance.conversations.im](https://compliance.conversations.im/).

The JSXC project has made a [managed XMPP server](https://www.jsxc.org/managed.html) available
which is now also  100% compliant with the [compliance tester](https://compliance.conversations.im/).

Also from JSXC, [XMPP Cloud Authentication is now available as Debian package](https://www.jsxc.org/blog/2018/08/20/xcauth-deb-packages.html).

The [Business Bot platform now also supports XMPP chatbots](https://blog.citunius.de/en/blog/2018/08/12/instant-messaging-with-xmpp-jabber).

ProgrammableWeb published a [four part series on push
protocols](https://www.programmableweb.com/api-university/how-and-why-to-provide-event-driven-streaming-apis).
In part 4, they mention [XMPP and XMPP-IoT](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/understanding-less-popular-pushstreaming-protocols-xmpp-coap-mqtt-etc/analysis/2017/12/11?utm_campaign=XMPP%20Newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=XMPP).
