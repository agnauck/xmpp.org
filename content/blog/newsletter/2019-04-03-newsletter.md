Welcome to the XMPP newsletter.

If you have an article, tutorial or blog post you'd like us to include in the
newsletter, please [submit it on the XMPP wiki](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).

## News

A design [job has been posted at the Open Source Design community](https://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/jobs/2019-03-19-design-of-badges-for-different-xmpp-compliance-levels) for Compliance Suite badges.
It is an initiative that aims to create graphic elements for developers to use on their clients and servers to be able to identify compliance levels of such software.

A [wiki page to keep track of integrations has been created at the XSF's Wiki](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Integrations). The idea behind it is to take a look at projects or services that support features like notifications but do not include XMPP as part of the integrations they support.
This page can be used to follow integrations on all kind of software and make it visible so other people can work or promote them.
