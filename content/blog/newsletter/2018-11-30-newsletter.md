## News

In the Netherlands a commercial chat service based on XMPP and a modified version of
the open-source Xabber client for Android was compromised when the Dutch police gained
access to the server and implemented a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on encrypted conversations
that used Off-The-Record (OTR) encryption.

OTR and other encryption technologies such as OMEMO only guarantee end-to-end
security if you are able to verify the fingerprints of your contacts' encryption keys. In
this case it appears users did not verify and ignored warnings (which were too small and easily missed),
and this opened the door to a MITM attack by anyone with access to the server.

The attack in this instance was for law enforcement. However it serves to highlight the
importance of designing user interfaces that encourage good security practices, and educating
users. It also highlights problems with centralized services - all IronChat users were on a
single XMPP server, which meant a single place to compromise and access all IronChat
conversations. A federated network does not have a single point through which all messages
pass.

It seems the service was popular with criminals, which is why the police got involved,
and various arrests were made. Here's the [original article in Dutch](https://nos.nl/artikel/2258309-beveiliging-door-politie-gekraakte-cryptofoons-was-twijfelachtig.html)

Paul Schaub has written about a [QR-code generator for OMEMO](https://blog.jabberhead.tk/2018/11/03/qr-code-generator-for-omemo/)
which he has been working on. It encodes the Jabber-ID of the owner as well as any OMEMO
fingerprints they choose to include.

JC Brand has written about the [recent XMPP sprint held in Dusseldorf](https://opkode.com/blog/xmpp-sprint-dusseldorf/).

The well-known Kuketz blog in Germany wrote an article [XMPP is not the savior - but a solution](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuketz-blog.de%2Fmessenger-xmpp-ist-nicht-der-heilsbringer-aber-eine-loesung%2F)
(Google machine-translated version). Here's the [original German version](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/messenger-xmpp-ist-nicht-der-heilsbringer-aber-eine-loesung/).
It's in part a response to [XMPP: Admin-in-the-middle](https://infosec-handbook.eu/blog/xmpp-aitm/), written by the InfoSec Handbook
which details how XMPP server administrators have access to user's metadata and
other sensitive information.

The German email provider mailbox.org, has [unveiled a revamped website](https://mailbox.org/en/post/a-new-logo-a-new-website-new-software-versions-and-new-features-at-mailbox-org)
