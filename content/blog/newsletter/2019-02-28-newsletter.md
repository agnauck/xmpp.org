### FOSDEM

In the beginning of February was the annual [FOSDEM19](https://fosdem.org/2019/) conference in Brussels
which was well attended by XMPP enthusiasts and where 5 different talks related
to XMPP were held.

The videos for the FOSDEM presentations have been released:

* [XMPP Beyond Instant Messaging](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/xmpp_beyond_im/)

In this talk Jérôme Poisson (Goffi) shows how XMPP can be used to build non-IM
applications, such as a blog engine, file sharing, a code forge, a universal remote
controller and even a decentralized web framework on top of XMPP.

* [Salut à Toi: A Python Based Social Network And More](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/python_salut_a_toi_network/)

Jérôme Poisson talks about Salut à Toi, a Python-based decentralized communication ecosystem
which uses XMPP and offers a lot of features like chat, e2e encryption, file sharing, photo
albums, events, (micro)blogging, forums, remote control, tickets,
merge-requests and even a decentralized web framework.

* [Make XMPP Sprint Again](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/xmpp_sprint/)

Maxime Buquet (pep.) talks about how he organized the August 18-19th XMPP
community sprint in Cambridge and gives useful advice to anyone interesting in
organising community events such as development sprints.

* [Unified Communications with Pàdé](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/pade/)

Dele Olajide talks about Pàdé, a new unified communications solution from the
ignite Real-time community that integrates protocols such as SIP, HTTP and XMPP
into one desktop solution for text, voice and video communication.

* [Converse: Open, federated teamchat with XMPP](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/converse_xmpp/)

JC Brand talks about Converse.js, a JavaScript XMPP chat client that runs in
the browser and which saw lots of improvements in 2018, including a new
fullscreen teamchat mode.
