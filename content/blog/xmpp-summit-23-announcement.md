The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) will hold its 23th XMPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday January 31st and Friday February 1st 2019. These are the two days preceding FOSDEM 2019.

The XSF invites you all to attend, and discuss all things XMPP!

If you're interested in attending, please make yourself known by filling out your details on the [wiki page for Summit 23](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summit_23) (to edit the page, you'll need a wiki account, which we'll happily provide for you. Find us either in the [jdev@conference.jabber.org](xmpp:jdev@conference.jabber.org?join) chatroom, or via the [Summit mailling list](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/summit)).

Please note that, although we welcome everyone to join, you must announce your attendance beforehand, as the venue is not publicly accessible (and we need badges printed for you).

If you haven't already, make sure that you're signed up to the [Summit mailling list](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/summit), which is where you can expect most updates to be announced.

See you there!
